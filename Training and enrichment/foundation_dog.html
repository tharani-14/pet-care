        <p class="desc"><b>But here’s the thing about dog training: it’s changing. The more we learn about our dogs, about their needs, wants, emotional and cognitive lives, the more exciting and rich the world of dog training is becoming. And the more we understand, the faster, and better we can create harmonious lives with our dogs, lives that foster joy for both people and dogs together. In fact, we’ve learned that training is just one small piece of building a great life with a dog, and that many “training problems” 
            are better solved with other tools, like enrichment, socialization, safety and wellness, and communication.</b> </p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Your dog is great.</b> Yep, we know that for a fact, and we want you to know that and experience that, too, if you don’t already! And how can we be sure? As we said above, the more we learn about the exquisite sensitivities and abilities of our canine companions, the more we realize that dogs, every dog, is an extraordinary being. And the more we know about the species, the more we can see and react to individual differences between dogs, too. What we’ve found out is the differences that are often attributed to “good” and “naughty” dogs (“stubborn”/”cooperative”, “smart”/”stupid”, “friendly”/”aggressive”… the list goes on and on), are really our own misunderstandings of the needs and wants of each individual. In other words, dogs are great when their relationship with their humans and their worlds are safe, healthy, enriching, and built on two-way communication. 
            Your dog is already great, we cannot wait for him and you to grow that greatness and enjoy it.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>The way we live with our dogs and enjoy them is something we want you to have, too! </b> Because another thing we know for sure is that, contrary to the popular images of dog training and trainers out there, having a great relationship with your dog doesn’t depend on being a mystical, specially-endowed communicator. The skills that make for great training and relationships with dogs are available to all of us. You and your dog are awesome, so building an equally rich, rewarding relationship is a matter of knowledge, skills and adhering to a few bedrock principles in all that you do with your dog. Four, to be exact.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>What is the Harmony Model?
            Simply put, the harmony model distills the essential elements of living well with our dogs, and shows you how to apply them to your specific goals, issues and relationship with your dog. The harmony model allows you to: 
            
            Connect the dots between safety, wellness, and behavior, and act on it.
            Learn to listen and communicate with your dog. 
            Use socialization wisely throughout your dog’s life.
            Use smart enrichment to build ease and joy into a busy life.
            Design and implement positive training to build skills, relationship and trust.</b></p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Training</b> <br>Training, in the term positive training, is about teaching dogs the skills they need to thrive in a world that’s not necessarily built with them in mind – our human world. In order to live your best life with your dog in our world you will have to teach her a few skills and those skills will vary depending on your dream and where and how you live. So what to teach and how to teach it. Identifying and teaching YOUR dog the skills she needs to thrive in YOUR world is key. As your dog’s trainer, or teacher, you will work to identify those missing skills, to set up the learning environment so that your dog can build richer and richer repertoires that allow her to navigate this foreign world by your side and with your guidance.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Safety and Wellness </b> <br>Think about teaching children to swim. Before we allow them to swim in open water, we choose a place to swim where the water is smooth and controlled, perhaps a pool or a calm natural body of water. And before we got to swimming in the pool, we likely taught the motions of swimming in a place where they could stand up, it might have even been outside of the pool! Even before that, we introduced the children to water, by splashing around in the shallow end, getting used to the sensation of water touching their bodies, of holding their breath when they dip their heads under. And even before that we would want to show a child a pool, pond or lake, perhaps poking a stick into it, or watching others get in. Water can be emotionally challenging for many kids (and many adults, too)-- not being able to see the bottom, or what might be touching you is new, and developing confidence with that strange new reality is essential to learning anything in it!</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Communication</b> <br>Any harmonious relationship depends on communication, and your joyful life with your dog is no exception. In order to teach her, you’re going to need to know how to communicate with her. And in order to talk to her, you’ll need to first learn how to listen. If you can do both you can help fulfill her needs and yours, communicate what you need, and solve your problems! Clear communication will also save you time when teaching.

            Dogs whose communication (including body language) is heard and understood can tell us what they need/want in the body language equivalent of whispers. When they don’t have to shout, we can build a fulfilling relationship based on mutual understanding</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Socialization</b> <br>Dogs are social animals just as humans are: it’s part of why we love each other as a species, and part of our ancient bond! They also have exquisite senses and awareness of smell, hearing and others. Being social and environmentally attuned is beautiful, but it also means being socially sensitive. Dogs notice a lot, process a lot, and learn a lot about what’s safe, what's fun, what’s worth engaging and what’s worth avoiding, from how and when they meet these things. Seeing the world from the dog’s point of view can help us understand what socializing is joyful and what’s just too much. 

            This is the meaning of socialization. As our dogs’ guardians, we can bring harmony into our dogs' lives by intentionally planning exposure to places, people, animals and things, always keeping their experience in mind.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Enrichment</b> <br>Even the most sophisticated modern dog is, well, a dog! Which means he has dog needs, dog interests, and dog hobbies, such as:

            Digging
            Chewing
            Foraging/scavenging/hunting
            Sniffing
            Resting 
            and many other species appropriate behaviors 
            These doggy hobbies will find a way to express themselves, even if we try to suppress them (and we shouldn’t). And it should be in a dog’s bill of rights that he is allowed to be himself, maybe especially in these quintessentially canine ways.
            
            Because our modern homes and environments often don’t naturally present convenient places to express these canine needs, enrichment is an important part of living in harmony with our dogs. Enrichment, simply, is creating opportunities for your dog to express natural behavior in an appropriate way. Effective enrichment creates chances for your dog to :
            
            Forage for their meals
            Sniff in new places
            Chew appropriate items
            Enjoy unrestricted movement
            Express appropriate & functional play 
            And pursue their individual joy when safe</p>

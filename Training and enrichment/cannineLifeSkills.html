The definition we use at Positively, is any skill that helps your dog thrive in the environment because she knows what to do in certain situations with or without being cued. Life skills are learned behaviors that you can teach your dog that have a useful function. Simple skills like learning to "stand" and "touch" to more advanced ones like "come" and "settle," have real world applications that help dogs cope and builds a common language between you</b></p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Any dog can learn this way</b><br>Teaching your dog or puppy basic skills is important for general safety and is a great way to increase the bond and communication between you. But these skills are also the building blocks needed later in life to allow you to modify more serious and difficult-to-solve behavior issues like aggression or reactivity if they occur. It's never too early or too late to begin teaching your dog skills she can use to navigate her world.</p>

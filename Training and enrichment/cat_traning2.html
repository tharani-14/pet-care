            <p class="desc"><b>Communicating with one’s cat can be frustrating, seeing as we don’t speak the same language. If training your cat has been difficult, positive reinforcement using clicker-training might work for you.

                Clicker training enforces wanted behavior and does not punish unwanted behavior, using the simple and precise language of a click</b></p>

        <p class="desc"><b>What is negative reinforcement?</b> <br>An example of negative reinforcement would be to press on your cat’s behind until they sit, and once they sit the pressure of your hand is removed. This shows the cat that when they sit, they will be rewarded by the removal of your hand’s pressure.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>What is positive reinforcement?</b> <br>Positive reinforcement would be giving your cat a treat when they sit, showing them what is wanted. In this way, positive reinforcement training is better for the human-feline relationship as well as overall efficiency in training.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Using Positive Reinforcement To Improve Behavior</b> <br>Positive reinforcement can be used to improve your cat’s behavior. The simplest way is through a method called clicker training.

            With positive reinforcement, you’re clicking and rewarding your cat when they do a desired behavior. If they do something you don’t want, you ignore it and ask for something you do want.
            
            Your cat isn’t punished for doing the wrong thing which makes them want to keep participating in this training game. Over time, your cat will do more of what you want them to do and less of what you don’t want them to do, thus improving behavior.</p>

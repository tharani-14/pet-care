            From the dog's perspective, activities like jumping on guests, barking at passersby, and chewing on slippers are simply natural and rewarding behaviors, but of course in our world such actions are often not acceptable and considered a 'nuisance.'
            
            While we should always keep the dog's point of view in mind and appreciate the need to allow dogs to be dogs as much as possible, the fact remains that many of these behaviors do indeed need to curbed or managed.</b></p>

Once you've ruled out medical causes, use the links in this section to understand why your dog does certain behaviors and teach skills that will replace behaviors you don't want him to do with behaviors you like and that make sense to him.</p>

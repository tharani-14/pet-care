        <p class="desc"><b>Providing Hiding Places and Varied Diet and Feeding Methods</b><br>Incorporate live or artificial plants, driftwood, rocks, and caves into the aquarium to create hiding spots.
            Hiding places offer security and reduce stress by allowing fish to retreat when feeling threatened or overwhelmed. Offer a diverse diet that includes live, frozen, and freeze-dried foods in addition to commercial fish pellets or flakes.
            Use feeding devices such as floating feeders, slow-release feeders, or puzzle feeders to encourage natural foraging behaviors and prevent overeating.</p>

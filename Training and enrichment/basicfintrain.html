            <p class="desc"><b>Basic training for fish involves teaching them simple behaviors such as target training, feeding response training, and navigating through obstacle courses. Target training introduces fish to touch a designated target, while feeding response training associates specific cues with feeding times. Obstacle courses provide mental stimulation and physical exercise. </b></p>

It's essential to understand the natural behaviors and capabilities of the fish species you're training and tailor training methods accordingly. With dedication and practice, fish can learn a variety of behaviors and tricks, enriching their lives and deepening the bond between fish and caregiver.</b> </p>

            Start by presenting the target near the fish and rewarding them with a treat when they approach or touch it.
            Gradually shape the behavior by moving the target to different locations and rewarding successive approximations of the desired behavior.Target training involves teaching fish to touch a designated target, such as a stick or finger. By rewarding fish for interacting with the target, caregivers can teach them new behaviors and commands.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Feeding Response Training</b> <br>
            Associate a specific cue, such as tapping on the aquarium glass or ringing a bell, with feeding time.
            Consistently use the cue before feeding fish and reward them with food immediately afterward.
            Over time, fish will learn to associate the cue with feeding time and respond accordingly.

        <p class="desc"><b>Obstacle Courses </b><br>Design simple obstacle courses using hoops, tunnels, or floating objects for fish to navigate through.
            Guide fish through the course using the target training method, rewarding them for successfully completing each section.
            Increase the difficulty of the course gradually as fish become more proficient.</p>

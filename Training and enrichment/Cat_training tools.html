        <p class="desc"><b>Clicker</b><br>A clicker is a small handheld device with a button. When you press the button, it makes a click sound. In clicker training, your cat is trained to understand that this sound means they did the right behavior and are about to get a treat.


            These clickers are the ones I use. They’re small, relatively quiet so they don’t frighten your cat, and they have a wrist strap so you don’t drop it.
            
            Even though they come in a pack of 10, having more than one clicker is helpful. You can stash one in every room of the house and keep them in your pockets so you’re never without one.
            
            It’s nice to have backups for when one breaks or you lose one. You can even gift them to friends after they see the cool things you’re teaching your cat.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>High-Value Treats</b> <br>Treats are how you’ll reward your cat. While using your cat’s regular kibble sounds like a good idea, your cat will likely think otherwise. They want something they don’t get all the time.

            Here are a few things to keep in mind when picking out cat training treats. You want your treats to be:
            
            High-Value
            Small in size
            Low in calories
            For training, you want to have special treats your cat loves, or else your cat may decide the reward isn’t worth what you’re asking of them.
            
            
            The treats should be small, about the size of a pea, so that it doesn’t take long to eat. You want your training sessions to go fast and not get bogged down with chewing.
            
            Lastly, the treats should be low in calories. Treats should account for no more than 10% of your cat’s daily calories. If you’re training for 5 minutes, you’ll use around 15-25 treats. That’s a lot of treats!
            
            I like these freeze-dried raw treats because they’re easily broken into a small size, are high protein, and have low calories.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Target Stick </b> <br>Training your cat to touch their nose or paw to a ball at the end of a stick is one of the first things you’ll train. This ball is called a target and is easy to move around when it’s on the end of a stick.

            For cats, I recommend an extendable target stick like this one. The target at the end is small which is perfect for cats.
            
            You can extend it out to have your cat farther away from you but it can store compactly. Even better is that this version has a clicker built into the handle so you don’t have to fumble around trying to hold two things in one hand while training.
            
            
            There are other versions of target sticks that don’t have built-in clickers. These are good if you like holding the target in the opposite hand that you hold the clicker in.</p>

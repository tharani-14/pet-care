        <p class="desc"><b>Can Your Cat Laugh?</b><br>No, your cat cannot technically laugh, but they have other signs to show that they are happy.  Purring is your cat’s main way of expressing that they are happy. 

            Some people even consider purring as equivalent to cat laughter. That’s fine, but it’s not technically the same.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>What signs does a cat show when they are happy?</b> <br>If your cat is happy and loves you, they will come to cuddle with you. When you are sleeping or sitting on the couch, your cat will want to be right there with you. 

            When they are sleeping, they may even purr to show you that they are happy to be around you. These are all signs that your cat is happy and content.  </p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Do cats know when people laugh?</b> <br>If your cat just did something cute or funny, you may have laughed at them.  Your cat will know that you are laughing at them. 

            Cats are very aware of their owner’s reactions and feelings.  They are great at sensing when you are happy, sad, or even sick. 
            
            If you laughed at your cat, they may even seem to get embarrassed and hide.  Some cats are more outgoing and love to be the center of attention, while others are shyer and will hide if they think that you are laughing at them. 
            
            Your cat may even do things on purpose to make you laugh at them.  Cats are always getting into mischief. 
            
            If you have a cat that is very personable and loves attention, they may do things to make you laugh and get your attention. </p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Physical Enrichment</b><br>Physical objects can include furniture, bedding, toys, new locations, and novel objects.

            It’s everything encompassing a physical object or place.
            
            Cat furniture and bedding make up the framework of your pet’s environment.
            
            Novelty is introduced through the inclusion of taking your pet to a new location, giving new toys, or presenting items they’re already familiar with, in a new and exciting way.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b> Cognitive Enrichment</b> <br>Cognitive enrichment gets your cat to use their mind. They have to think things through to figure out their task.

            Positive reinforcement-based training (also called clicker training) is one way to get your cat thinking. This form of training has been scientifically shown to get the fastest long-term results.
            
            It works by reinforcing (usually by food or praise) the good behavior and ignoring/redirecting the undesired behaviors. This positive pet training keeps training fun and your cat interested.
            
            Cognitive enrichment can also include your cat working for their food since hunting is a core part of your pet’s natural history.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Sensory Enrichment</b> <br>Sensory enrichment encompasses the 5 senses of sight, smell, touch, taste, and hear.

            Allowing your cat to be able to look out the windows at wildlife or people walking by is visually enriching.
            
            Using pet-safe spices and extracts for your pet to smell is an easy way to incorporate scent enrichment.
            
            Having different textures or items for your pet to roll or rub on is tactile enrichment.
            
            Feeding a novel food item or adding broth to your pet’s regular food will enrich your cat’s taste.
            
            Playing music while you’re gone or leaving the tv on is auditory enrichment.</p>

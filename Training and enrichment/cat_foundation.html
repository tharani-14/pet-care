        <p class="desc"><b>Training A Cat To Walk In A Harness</b> <br>First things first, you’ll need a harness. This isn’t as simple as going to the pet store and grabbing the first one you see.

            In fact, many of the harnesses out there were originally made for dogs and then manufactured smaller to fit a cat. But with how flexible cats are, this is a recipe for disaster.
            
            The last thing you want is for your cat to slip out of their harness while they’re outside. This is a dangerous situation where your cat could become injured or even killed.
            
            So before you start with the training, please read my article about the Best Harnesses and Leashes for Cats to help you pick out a harness that is escape-proof for your furry friend.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Training Steps</b> In order to harness train, your cat should already be trained to target. If yours isn’t, follow my steps for target training and harness training guide before continuing on.

            Place the harness on the ground in front of you. Whenever your cat positively interracts with teh harness, click and reward them with a treat.
            Hold the harness up and open it. Use the target stick to get your cat to stick their head halfway into the harness. Click and treat.
            Continue working on getting your cat’s head into the harness until they feel comfortable with their head all the way through. Click and give a treat each time.
            Next, work on slowly brining the harness between your cat’s legs and buckle it over their back. Click and give a treat. Go very slowly here so your cat isn’t afraid.
            Once the harness is completely buckled, use the target stick to coax your cat to move around, getting them used to moving in the harness. Click and treat.
            Work up to slowly tightening and and adjusting the harness to fit, making sure to click and treat throughout the process.
            Slowly build up the time your cat wears the harness. Focus on rewarding your cat whenever they’re in the harness.</p>

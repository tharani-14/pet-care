            <p class="desc"><b>Advanced training for fish delves into more complex behaviors like trick training, discrimination training, and agility training. Trick training teaches fish entertaining behaviors, discrimination training challenges them to differentiate between stimuli, and agility training tests their coordination and speed. </b></p>

It's essential to understand the natural behaviors and capabilities of the fish species you're training and tailor training methods accordingly. With dedication and practice, fish can learn a variety of behaviors and tricks, enriching their lives and deepening the bond between fish and caregiver.</b> </p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Trick Training</b> <br>Teach fish to perform tricks such as swimming through hoops, pushing objects, or playing with toys.
            Break down each trick into smaller, achievable steps and reinforce each step with rewards.
            With patience and consistency, gradually chain the steps together until the fish can perform the entire trick on command.</p>

        <p class="desc"><b>Discrimination Training</b> <br>
            Train fish to differentiate between colors, shapes, or symbols using positive reinforcement techniques.
Present the fish with different stimuli and reward them for correctly identifying the target stimulus.
Increase the complexity of discrimination tasks over time, challenging the fish's cognitive abilities.

        <p class="desc"><b>Agility Training</b><br>Design challenging agility courses that test fish's agility, speed, and coordination.
            Incorporate obstacles, tunnels, and narrow passages for fish to navigate through.
            Reward fish for successfully completing each section of the course and gradually increase the difficulty level.</p>
